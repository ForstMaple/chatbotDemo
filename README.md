3. Key in your bot token and change Redis host to `localhost` or as configured in `config.toml`
4. Install all required libraries in `requirements.txt`
5. Run the chatbot using `python bot.py` in the command line

If you want to try out the deployed chatbot on AWS, please contact [Yufeng Feng](mailto:yufengf@u.nus.edu) . The chatbot is off by defaut.
